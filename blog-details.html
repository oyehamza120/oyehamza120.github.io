	<h1 class="post-title entry-title">1)--10 reasons why PCs crash that you must know</a></h1>
<div class="post-header">&nbsp;</div>
<div id="post-body-7795990965779024488" class="post-body entry-content">
<div dir="ltr">Fatal error: the system has become unstable or is busy,&rdquo; it says. &ldquo;Enter to return to Windows or press Control-Alt-Delete to restart your computer. If you do this you will lose any unsaved information in all open applications.&rdquo;</div>
<div dir="ltr">You have just been struck by the Blue Screen of Death. Anyone who uses Mcft Windows will be familiar with this. What can you do? More importantly, how can you prevent it happening?<br /><br /><strong>1. Hardware conflict</strong><br /><br />The number one reason why Windows crashes is hardware conflict. Each hardware device communicates to other devices through an interrupt request channel (IRQ). These are supposed to be unique for each device.<br /><br />For example, a printer usually connects internally on IRQ 7. The keyboard usually uses IRQ 1 and the floppy disk drive IRQ 6. Each device will try to hog a single IRQ for itself.<br /><br />If there are a lot of devices, or if they are not installed properly, two of them may end up sharing the same IRQ number. When the user tries to use both devices at the same time, a crash can happen. The way to check if your computer has a hardware conflict is through the following route:<br /><br />* Start-Settings-Control Panel-System-Device Manager.<br /><br />Often if a device has a problem a yellow &lsquo;!&rsquo; appears next to its description in the Device Manager. Highlight Computer (in the Device Manager) and press Properties to see the IRQ numbers used by your computer. If the IRQ number appears twice, two devices may be using it.<br /><br />Sometimes a device might share an IRQ with something described as &lsquo;IRQ holder for PCI steering&rsquo;. This can be ignored. The best way to fix this problem is to remove the problem device and reinstall it.<br /><br />Sometimes you may have to find more recent drivers on the internet to make the device function properly. A good resource is http://www.driverguide.com. If the device is a soundcard, or a modem, it can often be fixed by moving it to a different slot on the motherboard (be careful about opening your computer, as you may void the warranty).<br /><br />When working inside a computer you should switch it off, unplug the mains lead and touch an unpainted metal surface to discharge any static electricity.<br /><br />To be fair to Mcft, the problem with IRQ numbers is not of its making. It is a legacy problem going back to the first PC designs using the IBM 8086 chip. Initially there were only eight IRQs. Today there are 16 IRQs in a PC. It is easy to run out of them. There are plans to increase the number of IRQs in future designs.<br /><br /><br /><strong>2. Bad Ram</strong><br /><br />Ram (random-access memory) problems might bring on the blue screen of death with a message saying Fatal Exception Error. A fatal error indicates a serious hardware problem. Sometimes it may mean a part is damaged and will need replacing.<br /><br />But a fatal error caused by Ram might be caused by a mismatch of chips. For example, mixing 70-nanosecond (70ns) Ram with 60ns Ram will usually force the computer to run all the Ram at the slower speed. This will often crash the machine if the Ram is overworked.<br /><br />One way around this problem is to enter the BIOS settings and increase the wait state of the Ram. This can make it more stable. Another way to troubleshoot a suspected Ram problem is to rearrange the Ram chips on the motherboard, or take some of them out. Then try to repeat the circumstances that caused the crash. When handling Ram try not to touch the gold connections, as they can be easily damaged.<br /><br />Parity error messages also refer to Ram. Modern Ram chips are either parity (ECC) or non parity (non-ECC). It is best not to mix the two types, as this can be a cause of trouble.<br /><br />EMM386 error messages refer to memory problems but may not be connected to bad Ram. This may be due to free memory problems often linked to old Dos-based programmes.<br /><br /><img src="https://mikehacks.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/download-app-1.gif?w=474" /><br /><br /><br /><strong>3. BIOS settings</strong><br /><br />Every motherboard is supplied with a range of chipset settings that are decided in the factory. A common way to access these settings is to press the F2 or delete button during the first few seconds of a boot-up.<br /><br />Once inside the BIOS, great care should be taken. It is a good idea to write down on a piece of paper all the settings that appear on the screen. That way, if you change something and the computer becomes more unstable, you will know what settings to revert to.<br /><br />A common BIOS error concerns the CAS latency. This refers to the Ram. Older EDO (extended data out) Ram has a CAS latency of 3. Newer SDRam has a CAS latency of 2. Setting the wrong figure can cause the Ram to lock up and freeze the computer&rsquo;s display.<br /><br />Mcft Windows is better at allocating IRQ numbers than any BIOS. If possible set the IRQ numbers to Auto in the BIOS. This will allow Windows to allocate the IRQ numbers (make sure the BIOS setting for Plug and Play OS is switched to &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to allow Windows to do this.).<br /><br /><br /><strong>4. Hard disk drives</strong><br /><br />After a few weeks, the information on a hard disk drive starts to become piecemeal or fragmented. It is a good idea to defragment the hard disk every week or so, to prevent the disk from causing a screen freeze. Go to<br /><br />* Start-Programs-Accessories-System Tools-Disk Defragmenter<br /><br />This will start the procedure. You will be unable to write data to the hard drive (to save it) while the disk is defragmenting, so it is a good idea to schedule the procedure for a period of inactivity using the Task Scheduler.<br /><br />The Task Scheduler should be one of the small icons on the bottom right of the Windows opening page (the desktop).<br /><br />Some lockups and screen freezes caused by hard disk problems can be solved by reducing the read-ahead optimisation. This can be adjusted by going to<br /><br />* Start-Settings-Control Panel-System Icon-Performance-File System-Hard Disk.<br /><br />Hard disks will slow down and crash if they are too full. Do some housekeeping on your hard drive every few months and free some space on it. Open the Windows folder on the C drive and find the Temporary Internet Files folder. Deleting the contents (not the folder) can free a lot of space.<br /><br />Empty the Recycle Bin every week to free more space. Hard disk drives should be scanned every week for errors or bad sectors. Go to<br /><br />* Start-Programs-Accessories-System Tools-ScanDisk<br /><br />Otherwise assign the Task Scheduler to perform this operation at night when the computer is not in use.<br /><br /><br /><strong>5. Fatal OE exceptions and VXD errors</strong><br /><br />Fatal OE exception errors and VXD errors are often caused by video card problems.<br /><br />These can often be resolved easily by reducing the resolution of the video display. Go to<br /><br />* Start-Settings-Control Panel-Display-Settings<br /><br />Here you should slide the screen area bar to the left. Take a look at the colour settings on the left of that window. For most desktops, high colour 16-bit depth is adequate.<br /><br />If the screen freezes or you experience system lockups it might be due to the video card. Make sure it does not have a hardware conflict. Go to<br /><br />* Start-Settings-Control Panel-System-Device Manager<br /><br />Here, select the + beside Display Adapter. A line of text describing your video card should appear. Select it (make it blue) and press properties. Then select Resources and select each line in the window. Look for a message that says No Conflicts.<br /><br />If you have video card hardware conflict, you will see it here. Be careful at this point and make a note of everything you do in case you make things worse.<br /><br />The way to resolve a hardware conflict is to uncheck the Use Automatic Settings box and hit the Change Settings button. You are searching for a setting that will display a No Conflicts message.<br /><br />Another useful way to resolve video problems is to go to<br /><br />* Start-Settings-Control Panel-System-Performance-Graphics<br /><br />Here you should move the Hardware Acceleration slider to the left. As ever, the most common cause of problems relating to graphics cards is old or faulty drivers (a driver is a small piece of software used by a computer to communicate with a device).<br /><br />Look up your video card&rsquo;s manufacturer on the internet and search for the most recent drivers for it.<br /><br /><br /><strong>6. Viruses</strong><br /><br />Often the first sign of a virus infection is instability. Some viruses erase the boot sector of a hard drive, making it impossible to start. This is why it is a good idea to create a Windows start-up disk. Go to<br /><br />* Start-Settings-Control Panel-Add/Remove Programs<br /><br />Here, look for the Start Up Disk tab. Virus protection requires constant vigilance.<br /><br />A virus scanner requires a list of virus signatures in order to be able to identify viruses. These signatures are stored in a DAT file. DAT files should be updated weekly from the website of your antivirus software manufacturer.<br /><br />An excellent antivirus programme is McAfee VirusScan by Network Associates ( http://www.nai.com). Another is Norton AntiVirus 2000, made by Symantec ( http://www.symantec.com).<br /><br /><img src="https://mikehacks.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/download-app-1.gif?w=474" /><br /><br /><br /><strong>7. Printers</strong><br /><br />The action of sending a document to print creates a bigger file, often called a postscript file.<br /><br />Printers have only a small amount of memory, called a buffer. This can be easily overloaded. Printing a document also uses a considerable amount of CPU power. This will also slow down the computer&rsquo;s performance.<br /><br />If the printer is trying to print unusual characters, these might not be recognised, and can crash the computer. Sometimes printers will not recover from a crash because of confusion in the buffer. A good way to clear the buffer is to unplug the printer for ten seconds. Booting up from a powerless state, also called a cold boot, will restore the printer&rsquo;s default settings and you may be able to carry on.<br /><br /><br /><strong>8. Software</strong><br /><br />A common cause of computer crash is faulty or badly-installed software. Often the problem can be cured by uninstalling the software and then reinstalling it. Use Norton Uninstall or Uninstall Shield to remove an application from your system properly. This will also remove references to the programme in the System Registry and leaves the way clear for a completely fresh copy.<br /><br />The System Registry can be corrupted by old references to obsolete software that you thought was uninstalled. Use Reg Cleaner by Jouni Vuorio to clean up the System Registry and remove obsolete entries. It works on Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE (Second Edition), Windows Millennium Edition (ME), NT4 and Windows 2000.<br /><br />Read the instructions and use it carefully so you don&rsquo;t do permanent damage to the Registry. If the Registry is damaged you will have to reinstall your operating system. Reg Cleaner can be obtained from http://www.jv16.org<br /><br />Often a Windows problem can be resolved by entering Safe Mode. This can be done during start-up. When you see the message &ldquo;Starting Windows&rdquo; press F4. This should take you into Safe Mode.<br /><br />Safe Mode loads a minimum of drivers. It allows you to find and fix problems that prevent Windows from loading properly.<br /><br />Sometimes installing Windows is difficult because of unsuitable BIOS settings. If you keep getting SUWIN error messages (Windows setup) during the Windows installation, then try entering the BIOS and disabling the CPU internal cache. Try to disable the Level 2 (L2) cache if that doesn&rsquo;t work.<br /><br />Remember to restore all the BIOS settings back to their former settings following installation.<br /><br /><br /><strong>9. Overheating</strong><br /><br />Central processing units (CPUs) are usually equipped with fans to keep them cool. If the fan fails or if the CPU gets old it may start to overheat and generate a particular kind of error called a kernel error. This is a common problem in chips that have been overclocked to operate at higher speeds than they are supposed to.<br /><br />One remedy is to get a bigger better fan and install it on top of the CPU. Specialist cooling fans/heatsinks are available from http://www.computernerd.com or http://www.coolit.com<br /><br />CPU problems can often be fixed by disabling the CPU internal cache in the BIOS. This will make the machine run more slowly, but it should also be more stable.<br /><br /><br /><strong>10. Power supply problems</strong><br /><br />With all the new construction going on around the country the steady supply of electricity has become disrupted. A power surge or spike can crash a computer as easily as a power cut.<br /><br />If this has become a nuisance for you then consider buying a uninterrupted power supply (UPS). This will give you a clean power supply when there is electricity, and it will give you a few minutes to perform a controlled shutdown in case of a power cut.<br /><br />It is a good investment if your data are critical, because a power cut will cause any unsaved data to be lost.</div>

I am sure that you would have heard about keylogger. Many of you might be of the notion that keylogger is a software, but this is not so. Keylogger could be hardware or software. It is meant for both legitimate and illegitimate jobs, but most of the times, it is used by the bad guys to spy on other's information.<br /><br />If you do not want anybody to have an illicit access to your information, you need to know to catch hold of this kind of process that might run in your system without your knowledge. Here is how, you can have a check on this process.<br /><br /><strong>Hardware keylogger:</strong><br />
<div class="separator"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_IiRTLl_Z7k/XHbIYefiEOI/AAAAAAAASgU/OyusppL2P-o7vh1FgHIBwKf2gFIL7YIhgCLcBGAs/s1600/a2.jpg"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_IiRTLl_Z7k/XHbIYefiEOI/AAAAAAAASgU/OyusppL2P-o7vh1FgHIBwKf2gFIL7YIhgCLcBGAs/s200/a2.jpg" width="200" height="146" border="0" data-original-height="184" data-original-width="251" /></a></div>
<div><strong><br /></strong>Hardware keylogger is the device that needs to be connected to the keyboard port. If you happen to locate it, you can have it disconnected, so that the keystrokes are not traced. <br /><br />An alternate method of having the hardware keylogger installed is by soldering it into the circuit of the keyboard. To make sure that you do not have it soldered into the keyboard, you need to disassemble the board and find if there is any such thing fixed.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Software keylogger:</strong><br />There are innumerous Software keyloggers that can be found online. Certain virus or malware programs have the ability to install keyloggers in your computer while running in your system. Most often, the keyloggers are used to have the credentials of important accounts, such as bank, social media, etc.<br /><br />There are few things that you can do to identify a software keylogger and here they are!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img src="https://mikehacks.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/download-app-1.gif?w=474" /><br /><br /><strong>1) Run an antivirus program</strong><br />You can run an antivirus program to find, if there is any keylogger installed in your system. You can land on the computer review sites to find which product is the suitable one to detect a software keylogger.<br /><br /><strong>2) Get rid of the malicious files</strong><br />Run your antivirus and anti-spyware programs almost daily, so that these programs protect you from the malware that is capable of running and sliding keylogger into your system. Make sure that the detected malicious files are either quarantined or removed from the system.<br /><br /><strong>3) Update antivirus software regularly</strong><br />We would suggest you to schedule updates for your antivirus program on a daily basis. If the virus definitions are open to updates more often, then there is less chance that your computer will be attacked by the trouble making malicious files.<br /><br />Hardware keyloggers are easy to find when compared with the software keylogger. However, you can make use of updated antivirus or anti-spyware to get rid of it.</div>

Do some housekeeping on your hard drive every few months and free some space on it. Open the Windows folder on the C drive and find the Temporary Internet Files folder. Deleting the contents (not the folder) can free a lot of space.<br /><br />Empty the Recycle Bin every week to free more space. Hard disk drives should be scanned every week for errors or bad sectors. Go to<br /><br />* Start-Programs-Accessories-System Tools-ScanDisk<br /><br />Otherwise assign the Task Scheduler to perform this operation at night when the computer is not in use.<br /><br /><br /><strong>5. Fatal OE exceptions and VXD errors</strong><br /><br />Fatal OE exception errors and VXD errors are often caused by video card problems.<br /><br />These can often be resolved easily by reducing the resolution of the video display. Go to<br /><br />* Start-Settings-Control Panel-Display-Settings<br /><br />Here you should slide the screen area bar to the left. Take a look at the colour settings on the left of that window. For most desktops, high colour 16-bit depth is adequate.<br /><br />If the screen freezes or you experience system lockups it might be due to the video card. Make sure it does not have a hardware conflict. Go to<br /><br />* Start-Settings-Control Panel-System-Device Manager<br /><br />Here, select the + beside Display Adapter. A line of text describing your video card should appear. Select it (make it blue) and press properties. Then select Resources and select each line in the window. Look for a message that says No Conflicts.<br /><br />If you have video card hardware conflict, you will see it here. Be careful at this point and make a note of everything you do in case you make things worse.<br /><br />The way to resolve a hardware conflict is to uncheck the Use Automatic Settings box and hit the Change Settings button. You are searching for a setting that will display a No Conflicts message.<br /><br />Another useful way to resolve video problems is to go to<br /><br />* Start-Settings-Control Panel-System-Performance-Graphics<br /><br />Here you should move the Hardware Acceleration slider to the left. As ever, the most common cause of problems relating to graphics cards is old or faulty drivers (a driver is a small piece of software used by a computer to communicate with a device).<br /><br />Look up your video card&rsquo;s manufacturer on the internet and search for the most recent drivers for it.<br /><br /><br /><strong>6. Viruses</strong><br /><br />Often the first sign of a virus infection is instability. Some viruses erase the boot sector of a hard drive, making it impossible to start. This is why it is a good idea to create a Windows start-up disk. Go to<br /><br />* Start-Settings-Control Panel-Add/Remove Programs<br /><br />Here, look for the Start Up Disk tab. Virus protection requires constant vigilance.<br /><br />A virus scanner requires a list of virus signatures in order to be able to identify viruses. These signatures are stored in a DAT file. DAT files should be updated weekly from the website of your antivirus software manufacturer.<br /><br />An excellent antivirus programme is McAfee VirusScan by Network Associates ( http://www.nai.com). Another is Norton AntiVirus 2000, made by Symantec ( http://www.symantec.com).<br /><br /><img src="https://mikehacks.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/download-app-1.gif?w=474" /><br /><br /><strong>7. Printers</strong><br /><br />The action of sending a document to print creates a bigger file, often called a postscript file.<br /><br />Printers have only a small amount of memory, called a buffer. This can be easily overloaded. Printing a document also uses a considerable amount of CPU power. This will also slow down the computer&rsquo;s performance.<br /><br />If the printer is trying to print unusual characters, these might not be recognised, and can crash the computer. Sometimes printers will not recover from a crash because of confusion in the buffer. A good way to clear the buffer is to unplug the printer for ten seconds. Booting up from a powerless state, also called a cold boot, will restore the printer&rsquo;s default settings and you may be able to carry on.<br /><br /><br /><strong>8. Software</strong><br /><br />A common cause of computer crash is faulty or badly-installed software. Often the problem can be cured by uninstalling the software and then reinstalling it. Use Norton Uninstall or Uninstall Shield to remove an application from your system properly. This will also remove references to the programme in the System Registry and leaves the way clear for a completely fresh copy.<br /><br />The System Registry can be corrupted by old references to obsolete software that you thought was uninstalled. Use Reg Cleaner by Jouni Vuorio to clean up the System Registry and remove obsolete entries. It works on Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE (Second Edition), Windows Millennium Edition (ME), NT4 and Windows 2000.<br /><br />Read the instructions and use it carefully so you don&rsquo;t do permanent damage to the Registry. If the Registry is damaged you will have to reinstall your operating system. Reg Cleaner can be obtained from http://www.jv16.org<br /><br />Often a Windows problem can be resolved by entering Safe Mode. This can be done during start-up. When you see the message &ldquo;Starting Windows&rdquo; press F4. This should take you into Safe Mode.<br /><br />Safe Mode loads a minimum of drivers. It allows you to find and fix problems that prevent Windows from loading properly.<br /><br />Sometimes installing Windows is difficult because of unsuitable BIOS settings. If you keep getting SUWIN error messages (Windows setup) during the Windows installation, then try entering the BIOS and disabling the CPU internal cache. Try to disable the Level 2 (L2) cache if that doesn&rsquo;t work.<br /><br />Remember to restore all the BIOS settings back to their former settings following installation.<br /><br /><br /><strong>9. Overheating</strong><br /><br />Central processing units (CPUs) are usually equipped with fans to keep them cool. If the fan fails or if the CPU gets old it may start to overheat and generate a particular kind of error called a kernel error. This is a common problem in chips that have been overclocked to operate at higher speeds than they are supposed to.<br /><br />One remedy is to get a bigger better fan and install it on top of the CPU. Specialist cooling fans/heatsinks are available from http://www.computernerd.com or http://www.coolit.com<br /><br />CPU problems can often be fixed by disabling the CPU internal cache in the BIOS. This will make the machine run more slowly, but it should also be more stable.<br /><br /><br /><strong>10. Power supply problems</strong><br /><br />With all the new construction going on around the country the steady supply of electricity has become disrupted. A power surge or spike can crash a computer as easily as a power cut.<br /><br />If this has become a nuisance for you then consider buying a uninterrupted power supply (UPS). This will give you a clean power supply when there is electricity, and it will give you a few minutes to perform a controlled shutdown in case of a power cut.<br /><br />It is a good investment if your data are critical, because a power cut will cause any unsaved data to be lost.</div>

I am sure that you would have heard about keylogger. Many of you might be of the notion that keylogger is a software, but this is not so. Keylogger could be hardware or software. It is meant for both legitimate and illegitimate jobs, but most of the times, it is used by the bad guys to spy on other's information.<br /><br />If you do not want anybody to have an illicit access to your information, you need to know to catch hold of this kind of process that might run in your system without your knowledge. Here is how, you can have a check on this process.<br /><br /><strong>Hardware keylogger:</strong><br />
<div class="separator"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_IiRTLl_Z7k/XHbIYefiEOI/AAAAAAAASgU/OyusppL2P-o7vh1FgHIBwKf2gFIL7YIhgCLcBGAs/s200/a2.jpg" width="200" height="146" border="0" data-original-height="184" data-original-width="251" /></div>
<div><strong><br /></strong>Hardware keylogger is the device that needs to be connected to the keyboard port. If you happen to locate it, you can have it disconnected, so that the keystrokes are not traced. <br /><br />An alternate method of having the hardware keylogger installed is by soldering it into the circuit of the keyboard. To make sure that you do not have it soldered into the keyboard, you need to disassemble the board and find if there is any such thing fixed.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Software keylogger:</strong><br />There are innumerous Software keyloggers that can be found online. Certain virus or malware programs have the ability to install keyloggers in your computer while running in your system. Most often, the keyloggers are used to have the credentials of important accounts, such as bank, social media, etc.<br /><br />There are few things that you can do to identify a software keylogger and here they are!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><img src="https://mikehacks.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/download-app-1.gif?w=474" /><br /><br /><br /><strong>1) Run an antivirus program</strong><br />You can run an antivirus program to find, if there is any keylogger installed in your system. You can land on the computer review sites to find which product is the suitable one to detect a software keylogger.<br /><br /><strong>2) Get rid of the malicious files</strong><br />Run your antivirus and anti-spywae programs almost daily, so that these programs protect you from the malware that is capable of running and sliding keylogger into your system. Make sure that the detected malicious files are either quarantined or removed from the system.<br /><br /><strong>3) Update antivirus software regularly</strong><br />We would suggest you to schedule updates for your antivirus program on a daily basis. If the virus definitions are open to updates more often, then there is less chance that your computer will be attacked by the trouble making malicious files.<br /><br />Hardware keyloggers are easy to find when compared with the software keylogger. However, you can make use of updated antivirus or anti-spyware to get rid of it.<br /><br /></div>

<h1 class="post-title entry-title">7 Tips To Get More Out Of Your WiFi Router</h1>
<div class="post-header">&nbsp;</div>
<div id="post-body-7071360037580310045" class="post-body entry-content">
<div dir="ltr">Wireless routers are a bit like relationships. You don't notice the problems until things go really wrong and they send you crazy. This behaviour is normally accompanied by naming calling and huge sighs! And at times, you can't understand what has gone wrong &ndash; but you blame the router anyway!<br /><br />However, sometimes is not the routers fault &ndash; it is yours. It's about time you accepted the blame and fix things pronto!
<div class="separator"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MyLwvin69fQ/XHARO91scSI/AAAAAAAASPI/1Q1sKRhliMc1j2B7-HuN97lxOqmSICCZQCLcBGAs/s1600/router.jpg"><br /><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MyLwvin69fQ/XHARO91scSI/AAAAAAAASPI/1Q1sKRhliMc1j2B7-HuN97lxOqmSICCZQCLcBGAs/s320/router.jpg" width="320" height="160" border="0" data-original-height="335" data-original-width="670" /></a></div>
<div><br /><br /><strong>1. Did you read the manual?</strong><br /><br />Remember all the times you wished your other half came with instructions? Yet you expect your router to perform miracles automatically! In your defense, we&rsquo;ve all done it, but just like your partners, routers are all different and need a little TLC. A quick read of the instructions will make sure you treat it right! If you didn't get a manual with your router you can download users guides from the supplier&rsquo;s website.<br /><br /><strong>2. You didn&rsquo;t learn the basics</strong><br /><br />You will be amazed how much better you get on with your wireless router if you have a basic understanding of its needs. This all may sound very complicated and techy, but the truth is its child&acute;s play.<br /><br /><strong>3. You never change</strong><br /><br />It&acute;s easy to get stuck in your ways, but you have to keep things fresh. Keep your router up to date, your ISP will often allow you to upgrade to a new model for free if it becomes their standard issue for new customers, additionally firmware updates from the manufacturer can help find and fix any bugs and generally improve the performance of your device.<br /><br /><strong>4. You&rsquo;re using the wrong technology for your needs</strong><br /><br />You might want to consider exactly what you need from your service and if your expectations are reasonable. Are you a seriously competitive online gamer? Chances are you should be connecting to your router <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">with a wired Ethernet connection</a>. Always on the move for business but need to stay plugged into the web? You&rsquo;re going to need a service <a href="https://mobi-data.co.uk/">specifically for international wireless roaming</a>. Take some time to think about what you actually need from your service before committing to a plan.<br /><br /><strong>5. You&rsquo;re embarrassed to be seen with it</strong><br /><br />Wireless routers are not the sexiest device you will ever own, but its what&acute;s on the inside that counts! And tucking your box in the corner out of the way may not be the best place to keep it. Ideally, it needs to be in range of all devices you use it for, and preferably an open space where it can breathe.</div>
<div><br /><img src="https://mikehacks.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/download-app-1.gif?w=474" /><br /><br /><br /><strong><br /></strong></div>
<div><strong>6. Something is interfering</strong><br /><br />This problem is more common than you realize. Routers work from a 2.4 GHz band &ndash; the same as many other household devices such as cordless phone, microwave and baby monitors. It could be that they are interfering with your router and affecting its performance. <br /><br /><strong>7. Interfering neighbors</strong><br /><br />One of the most common interference patterns for routers comes from next door. The chances are your neighbors connect over the same frequency as you and just like your own household devices. Might be sharing the same 2.4 GHz frequency as you.<br /><br />Naturally, if you live in a densely populated area, you could have any number of rivals competing for space on this limited band. The only real solution for now is getting a router that operates on dual bands simultaneously. Newer routers will often run on 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands at the same time, allowing the latest WiFi devices to connect on the much less congested 5 GHz band. Of course the other thing to consider is that your neighbors may be intentionally reducing your bandwidth by hogging it for themselves!</div>

<div dir="ltr">Ever wondered just what that enigmatic name means?<br /><br />Gaming and multimedia applications are some of the most satisfying programs you can get for your PC, but getting them to run properly isn&rsquo;t always as easy as it could be. First, the PC architecture was never designed as a gaming platform. Second, the wide-ranging nature of the PC means that one person&rsquo;s machine can be different from another. While games consoles all contain the same hardware, PCs don&rsquo;t: the massive range of difference can make gaming a headache.<br /><br /><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.techdipper.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/DirectX-2-1.jpg?fit=712%2C400&amp;ssl=1" alt="Image result for DirectX explained" width="400" height="224" /><br /><br />To alleviate as much of the pain as possible, Microsoft needed to introduce a common standard which all games and multimedia applications could follow &ndash; a common interface between the OS and whatever hardware is installed in the PC, if you like. This common interface is DirectX, something which can be the source of much confusion.<br /><br />DirectX is an interface designed to make certain programming tasks much easier, for both the game developer and the rest of us who just want to sit down and play the latest blockbuster. Before we can explain what DirectX is and how it works though, we need a little history lesson.<br /><br /><strong>DirectX history</strong><br />Any game needs to perform certain tasks again and again. It needs to watch for your input from mouse, joystick or keyboard, and it needs to be able to display screen images and play sounds or music. That&rsquo;s pretty much any game at the most simplistic level.<br /><br />Imagine how incredibly complex this was for programmers developing on the early pre-Windows PC architecture, then. Each programmer needed to develop their own way of reading the keyboard or detecting whether a joystick was even attached, let alone being used to play the game. Specific routines were needed even to display the simplest of images on the screen or play a simple sound.<br /><br />Essentially, the game programmers were talking directly to your PC&rsquo;s hardware at a fundamental level. When Microsoft introduced Windows, it was imperative for the stability and success of the PC platform that things were made easier for both the developer and the player. After all, who would bother writing games for a machine when they had to reinvent the wheel every time they began work on a new game? Microsoft&rsquo;s idea was simple: stop programmers talking directly to the hardware, and build a common toolkit which they could use instead. DirectX was born.<br /><br /><img src="https://mikehacks.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/download-app-1.gif?w=474" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>How it works</strong><br />At the most basic level, DirectX is an interface between the hardware in your PC and Windows itself, part of the Windows API or Application Programming Interface. Let&rsquo;s look at a practical example. When a game developer wants to play a sound file, it&rsquo;s simply a case of using the correct library function. When the game runs, this calls the DirectX API, which in turn plays the sound file. The developer doesn&rsquo;t need to know what type of sound card he&rsquo;s dealing with, what it&rsquo;s capable of, or how to talk to it. Microsoft has provided DirectX, and the sound card manufacturer has provided a DirectX-capable driver. He asks for the sound to be played, and it is &ndash; whichever machine it runs on.<br /><br />From our point of view as gamers, DirectX also makes things incredibly easy &ndash; at least in theory. You install a new sound card in place of your old one, and it comes with a DirectX driver. Next time you play your favourite game you can still hear sounds and music, and you haven&rsquo;t had to make any complex configuration changes.<br /><br />Originally, DirectX began life as a simple toolkit: early hardware was limited and only the most basic graphical functions were required. As hardware and software has evolved in complexity, so has DirectX. It&rsquo;s now much more than a graphical toolkit, and the term has come to encompass a massive selection of routines which deal with all sorts of hardware communication. For example, the DirectInput routines can deal with all sorts of input devices, from simple two-button mice to complex flight joysticks. Other parts include DirectSound for audio devices and DirectPlay provides a toolkit for online or multiplayer gaming.<br /><br /><strong>DirectX versions</strong><br />The current version of DirectX at time of writing is DirectX 9.0. This runs on all versions of Windows from Windows 98 up to and including Windows Server 2003 along with every revision in between. It doesn&rsquo;t run on Windows 95 though: if you have a machine with Windows 95 installed, you&rsquo;re stuck with the older and less capable 8.0a. Windows NT 4 also requires a specific version &ndash; in this case, it&rsquo;s DirectX 3.0a.<br /><br />With so many versions of DirectX available over the years, it becomes difficult to keep track of which version you need. In all but the most rare cases, all versions of DirectX are backwardly compatible &ndash; games which say they require DirectX 7 will happily run with more recent versions, but not with older copies. Many current titles explicitly state that they require DirectX 9, and won&rsquo;t run without the latest version installed. This is because they make use of new features introduced with this version, although it has been known for lazy developers to specify the very latest version as a requirement when the game in question doesn&rsquo;t use any of the new enhancements. Generally speaking though, if a title is version locked like this, you will need to upgrade before you can play. Improvements to the core DirectX code mean you may even see improvements in many titles when you upgrade to the latest build of DirectX. Downloading and installing DirectX need not be complex, either.<br /><br /><strong>Upgrading DirectX</strong><br />All available versions of Windows come with DirectX in one form or another as a core system component which cannot be removed, so you should always have at least a basic implementation of the system installed on your PC. However, many new games require the very latest version before they work properly, or even at all.<br /><br />Generally, the best place to install the latest version of DirectX from is the dedicated section of the Microsoft Web site, which is found at www.microsoft.com/windows/directx. As we went to press, the most recent build available for general download was DirectX 9.0b. You can download either a simple installer which will in turn download the components your system requires as it installs, or download the complete distribution package in one go for later offline installation.<br /><br />Another good source for DirectX is games themselves. If a game requires a specific version, it&rsquo;ll be on the installation CD and may even be installed automatically by the game&rsquo;s installer itself. You won&rsquo;t find it on magazine cover discs though, thanks to Microsoft&rsquo;s licensing terms.<br /><br /><strong>Diagnosing problems</strong><br /><br />Diagnosing problems with a DirectX installation can be problematic, especially if you don&rsquo;t know which one of the many components is causing your newly purchased game to fall over. Thankfully, Microsoft provides a useful utility called the DirectX Diagnostic Tool, although this isn&rsquo;t made obvious. You won&rsquo;t find this tool in the Start Menu with any version of Windows, and each tends to install it in a different place.<br /><br />The easiest way to use it is to open the Start Menu&rsquo;s Run dialog, type in dxdiag and then click OK. When the application first loads, it takes a few seconds to interrogate your DirectX installation and find any problems. First, the DirectX Files tab displays version information on each one of the files your installation uses. The Notes section at the bottom is worth checking, as missing or corrupted files will be flagged here.<br /><br />The tabs marked Display, Sound, Music, Input and Network all relate to specific areas of DirectX, and all but the Input tab provide tools to test the correct functioning on your hardware. Finally, the More Help tab provides a useful way to start the DirectX Troubleshooter, Microsoft&rsquo;s simple linear problem solving tool for many common DirectX issues.</div>

<h1 class="post-title entry-title">Broken IE: How to fix it?</h1>
<div class="post-header">&nbsp;</div>
<div id="post-body-8117727050196304166" class="post-body entry-content">
<div dir="ltr">So one of your friends, &ldquo;not you of course&rdquo;, has managed to nuke Internet Explorer and they are unsure how they did it. You&rsquo;ve eliminated the possibility of viruses and adware, so this just leaves you and a broken IE. Before you begin to even consider running a repair install of the OS, let&rsquo;s try to do a repair on IE instead.<br /><br /><strong>THE REPAIR PROCESS</strong><br /><br />Start the Registry Editor by typing regedit from the Run box. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ SOFTWARE \ Microsoft \ Active Setup \ Installed Components \ {89820200-ECBD-11cf-8B85-00AA005B4383} and then right-click the &ldquo;IsInstalled value.&rdquo; Click Modify. From there, you will change the value from 1 to 0. All right, go ahead and close the editor and reinstall IE from this location. /http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx<br /><br /><img src="https://mikehacks.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/download-app-1.gif?w=474" /><br /><br /><br /><strong>IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG</strong><br /><br />If messing with the registry and something goes horribly wrong, you can use &ldquo;Last Known Good Configuration (<strong>F8</strong> Safe Mode)&rdquo; or a Restore Point to get back to where you were before, with your settings. Then you can try again, this time taking care to watch the portion of the registry you are changing. Most people who have troubles with this end up changing the wrong registry key.<br /><br />Hope this tut helps some members.</div>
